鸟类到底有多聪明？直到最近，鸟类的智力水平还被认为处于低端状态。然而，事实证明，我们这些长着羽毛的朋友一点也不愚蠢。它们实际上可被称为地球上最聪明的生物之一。著名动物心理学家Irene Pepperberg博士比大多数人都更了解这一点。

Pepperberg 于1949年出生于纽约市。作为独生女，她把长尾小鹦鹉(parakeet)当作宠物养，并教它们说话。在哈佛大学攻读化学博士学位时，Pepperberg 偶然看到了一部关于动物智力的纪录片。由于着迷，她立即决定转行，但是她的教授劝阻了她，所以她继续了她的化学研究。尽管如此，在业余时间里，Pepperberg开始尽可能多地阅读有关动物智力的书籍。

1976 年完成学业后，Pepperberg 走进一家宠物店，购买了一只一岁大的非洲灰鹦鹉，将其命名为Alex，并打算对他进行研究。在接下来的30年里，直到2007 年Alex 去世，Pepperberg一直致力于研究Alex 能够学会做什么。

在Pepperberg 的研究之前，科学界普遍认为，处理与语言和理解相关的复杂问题需要一个巨大的灵长类动物(primate)大脑。Pepperberg 证明并非如此。她证明Alex 能够主动理解和使用英语。Alex学会了使用类似“我想要某物”或“我想去某地”这样的短句，而且显然想用这样的短句表达真实的愿望。

Alex还掌握了某些类别的概念，包括更大和更小，以及相同和不同。他能认出50种不同的物体，识别1-6这6 个数字，并能分辨出7种颜色和5 种形状。Alex 甚至懂得“零”的概念。当被问及两个相同物体之间的区别时，他会回答“没有”。他的词汇量大约是150 个单词，但是Alex 并不像宠物鹦鹉经常做的那样只是模仿人类的语言。他理解他所说的话，例如，在学习颜色后，Alex会被问及他自己是什么颜色。他只被告知了6 次答案后就学会了“灰色”。

Pepperberg 将Alex 推理和处理复杂信息的能力归功于她的训练方法。一开始，Pepperberg 采用了上一代研究人员使用的一些技术，但她拒绝使用其他有缺陷的技术。例如，她认为，鸟儿学会正确做某事时，给予它们不相关奖励（例如食物奖励）的传统训练方法只会造成混乱。所以她用给予相关奖励的方法来训练Alex。这意味着她会奖励Alex 他所正确识别的物体，而不是一个无关的物体。例如，当Alex 正确地辨认出一个软木塞时，他得到的奖励是软木塞，而不是他最喜欢的食物———腰果(cashew)。然而，为了给他点儿“甜头”，她还会允许Alex 要一个坚果或一片香蕉。

Alex 一直学习到最后，让脑子围着数字7 转，并且很享受在Pepperberg 的实验室里教两只年轻的鹦鹉———12 岁的 Griffin 和 8 岁的 Arthur，当他们咕哝着说话的时候，告诉他们“说得好一点”。 Pepperberg说：“他的情感成熟度相当于两岁的孩子，智力能力相当于五岁的孩子。”简而言之，Alex 不是笨蛋(birdbrain)。

How smart are birds, really? Until recently, bird intelligence was thought to be on the lower end of the spectrum. However, it turns out that our feathered friends are far from stupid. In fact, they may be among the smartest creatures on Earth. Dr. Irene Pepperberg, a renowned animal psychologist, knows this better than most.

Born in New York City in 1949, Pepperberg was an only child who kept parakeets as pets and taught them to talk. While pursuing a PhD in chemistry at Harvard, she stumbled upon a documentary about animal intelligence. Fascinated, she immediately decided to switch fields, though her professors discouraged her. So, she continued with her chemistry studies. Nonetheless, in her spare time, Pepperberg began reading everything she could about animal intelligence.

After completing her studies in 1976, Pepperberg walked into a pet store, bought a one-year-old African grey parrot, named him Alex, and set out to study him. For the next 30 years, until Alex's death in 2007, Pepperberg dedicated herself to researching what Alex could learn.

Before Pepperberg's work, the scientific consensus was that solving complex problems related to language and comprehension required a large primate brain. Pepperberg proved otherwise. She demonstrated that Alex could understand and use English proactively. He learned to use short phrases like "I want something" or "I want to go somewhere," clearly using these phrases to express real desires.

Alex also grasped certain abstract concepts, including bigger and smaller, as well as same and different. He could recognize 50 different objects, identify numbers from 1 to 6, and distinguish between 7 colors and 5 shapes. Alex even understood the concept of zero. When asked about the difference between two identical objects, he would respond, "none." His vocabulary consisted of about 150 words, but unlike pet parrots that often mimic human speech, Alex understood what he was saying. For example, when learning colors, Alex was asked what color he was. He learned to answer "grey" after being told only six times.

Pepperberg attributed Alex's ability to reason and process complex information to her training methods. Initially, she adopted some techniques used by previous researchers but rejected other flawed methods. For instance, she believed that traditional training methods, which rewarded birds with unrelated treats (like food) for correctly performing a task, only caused confusion. Instead, she used relevant rewards. This meant Alex was rewarded with the object he correctly identified, rather than an unrelated treat. For example, if Alex correctly identified a cork, he was rewarded with the cork, not his favorite food—a cashew. However, to give him a little "extra incentive," she would also allow Alex to ask for a nut or a piece of banana.

Alex continued learning until the end, obsessed with the number seven, and took pleasure in teaching two younger parrots—12-year-old Griffin and 8-year-old Arthur. When they mumbled during speech exercises, he would tell them to "talk better." Pepperberg said, “His emotional maturity was comparable to that of a two-year-old child, and his intellectual ability was comparable to a five-year-old.” In short, Alex was no birdbrain.

## Bird Researcher

How intelligent are birds really? Until recently, the intelligence level of birds was considered to be on the lower end. However, it turns out that our feathered friends are not foolish at all. They can actually be called one of the most intelligent creatures on Earth. Dr. Irene Pepperberg, a renowned animal psychologist, knows this better than most.

Born in New York City in 1949, Pepperberg was an only child who kept a parakeet as a pet and taught it to speak. While pursuing a PhD in chemistry at Harvard University, Pepperberg stumbled upon a documentary about animal intelligence. Fascinated, she decided to switch fields, but her professors dissuaded her, so she continued her chemical research. Nevertheless, in her spare time, Pepperberg began reading as much as she could about animal intelligence.

After completing her studies in 1976, Pepperberg walked into a pet store and bought a one-year-old African grey parrot, which she named Alex, intending to study him. For the next 30 years, until Alex's death in 2007, Pepperberg dedicated herself to researching what Alex could learn.

Before Pepperberg's research, it was commonly believed in the scientific community that dealing with complex problems related to language and understanding required a large primate brain. Pepperberg proved otherwise. She demonstrated that Alex could actively understand and use English. Alex learned to use phrases like "I want something" or "I want to go somewhere," and he clearly wanted to express genuine desires with such phrases.

Alex also mastered certain categories of concepts, including bigger and smaller, as well as same and different. He could recognize 50 different objects, identify the numbers 1-6, and distinguish between seven colors and five shapes. Alex even understood the concept of "zero." When asked about the difference between two identical objects, he would answer "none." His vocabulary was about 150 words, but Alex did not just mimic human language like pet parrots often do. He understood what he was saying; for example, after learning colors, Alex would be asked what color he was. He learned the answer "gray" after being told only six times.

Pepperberg attributed Alex's ability to reason and process complex information to her training methods. Initially, Pepperberg used some techniques employed by previous researchers, but she refused to use other flawed techniques. For example, she believed that the traditional training method of giving birds irrelevant rewards (such as food rewards) when they learned to do something correctly only caused confusion. So she trained Alex using relevant rewards. This meant that she would reward Alex with the object he correctly identified, not an unrelated object. For example, when Alex correctly identified a cork, his reward was the cork, not his favorite food—cashews. However, to give him a little "sweetener," she would still allow Alex to request a nut or a slice of banana.

Alex continued to learn until the end, wrapping his brain around the number 7 and enjoying teaching two younger parrots—12-year-old Griffin and 8-year-old Arthur—in Pepperberg's lab, telling them to "speak better" when they muttered. Pepperberg said, "His emotional maturity was equivalent to that of a two-year-old child, and his intellectual ability was comparable to that of a five-year-old child." In short, Alex was no birdbrain.
